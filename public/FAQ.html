			<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
			<p><span class="highlight">Q.  How many pupils  in a class?</span></p>
			<p>A.  Class sizes are kept small to ensure individual attention.  Numbers in each class 
			are kept to approximately 12 to ensure each child gets the attention they deserve.
			</p>
			<p><span class="highlight">Q.  My child is very shy?</span></p>
			<p>A. Each child is treated as an individual.  The point of the classes is to nurture each 
			child and to develop their self confidence.  This is done through plenty of fun and games and 
			confidence building exercises.  Each child is encouraged to work at their own pace. 
			</p>
			<p><span class="highlight">Q. Does everyone do the Grade Exams?</span></p>
			<p>A. Everyone is encouraged to take the grade exams at the end of the year however no body is 
			forced into anything they are not entirely comfortable with, and so, the exams are of course 
			optional.
			</p>
			<a class="backtotop" href="#header">back to top</a>
			<p><span class="highlight">Q. Explain the exams?</span></p>
			<p>A. The exams are held in association with The Irish Board of Speech and Drama.  The Speech, 
			Drama and Communications exams encourage children, young people and adults to be better 
			communicators, to increase their confidence, to develop their skills and talent and to foster 
			their own creativity.  The examiners are professional, encouraging and friendly, and generate a
			 relaxed atmosphere so that candidates can perform to their best ability.
